## Project Plan/ Assignment
> A record of our ideas and brainstorming for the project, and assignments given to different members of the team. Also included in github pages issues.

## Current Project Idea: 
A card matching game, where you match the cards to collect as many points as possible before the time runs out. Player scores will be displayed on a leaderboard, and personal scores are stored in an account that you can log into

## CPT Scoring Guideline:

| | Category | How We're Meeting This | Notes | 
| - | - | - | - | 
| 1 | Program Purpose and Function | a game? | once we decide what we're matching we can add more to this | 
| 2 | Data Abstraction | Storing user data in an account; leaderboards | | 
| 3 | Managing Complexity | | | 
| 4 | Procedural Abstraction | | The leaderboard could count as this? | 
| 5 | Algorithm Implementation | | |
